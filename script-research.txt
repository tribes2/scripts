# Script research

I had a rummage through script files available from various sources. I was curious about what they all did. I'm leaving my notes here for the fun of it.

## script descriptions for CT's Tribes2 distribution
dso cleaner - deletes DSO files
dtsview - improved the -show command by adding dtsview();
uberguy variant of freelook
halidekillsound - same as spinfusor.ch
jumpjetpilot - You can have a single key got Jump Jetting and adjust mouse sensitivity when piloting.
smallmouserange - something that makes the mouse range smaller
t1voice - t1 voices, duh
tournamentnetclient - seemingly a tribesnext tournament client, has some browser prototype stuff? didn't read it all that hard
uberfov, uberzoom
unreal tournament sound packs
some huds, includuing the same fps and ping huds as spinfusor.ch. has a speed hud tho so that's nice



## script descriptions for that other site with all the scripts
empsniperstatus - energy sound meter, probably annoying?
'encrypt'.vl2 - smoo^ followed by position dependent string replacement logic. neat, but the static keyspace makes it kinda silly
esnvol - ingame volume settings hud
engineerhud - tactical assets and repair state, way better written than teamassetfinder by the looks



## script descriptions for spinfusor.ch
AutoOutput is a demo clipper script - give it some times, it'll give you thousands of screenshots
autoflag - say help 3s after picking up the flag, auto cannedchat
autoflare - sometimes regarded as a cheat
beaconstop - corrupt
bluegui - a gui that is blue
bombercrew - auto team chat when flares low and upon mounting vehicle. " NO FLARES LEFT - I'll cross my fingers" was a good string

demofolders - some sort of demo mgmt scripting
demonames - auto demo naming script based on server connection details
demorefreshbutton - calls rebuildmodpaths then reloads the recording dlg
destroyedassets - looks like a neat asset kill msg tracker with hud elements
doublefavourites - instead of 0-9 it's 0-19 with a modifier key
droplink - script to send <t2server:127.0.0.1:9001>name</t2server> to an irc room
dropnonloadout - does what it says on the tin, but dio called it 'scavenge' which i like more
DSOPoses - not sure what DSO stands for but PlayAnim with "scoutRoot" is weird and "sitting" is sitting
FilterMsg - "SplitMsg" clone, explains the odd video where chat is split into multiple panes. kill feed, chat feed, etc...
FilterPopUp - changes filter text to nice pop up menu? dunno
flagcall - another autoflag script, this is where people get the kmph messages from in some demos i guess. also has a no flare missile lock msg because why not i guess?

flagindicators - changes textures\commander\miniicons\com_flag_grey.png
flagradio - plays a random wav file whenever someone caps
flagslide - some rabbit related flag hud?
fluxvoice - pitch shifting voice hud
fpshud - 1000ms refresh with realfps - seems to be the smol one ppl like
freelook - seems to call hudFirstPersonToggled and $firstPerson = false; to enable 'third person and free look' which i assume is observer cam but who knows
frostytransgui - transparent/no gui
gameirc - irc but while you play the game, be cool to link irc back to discord
grabspeed - another autochat grab speed thing
grenadethrow - spams the server with grenade charges every mouse click so next grenade throw is as far as possible, should be made more efficient though...
halide - quite a few scripts, by the looks. there's a buddy checker which runs constantly, there's binds to show various other guids, permanent deployer gui to show when deployables are ok to deploy (does it spam? idk), low ammo auto weapon switcher and gui, binding disconnect and quit to keys, start screen tab preference options
hidechainret - hides chaingun reticle when firing (so you can look at the pretty tracers)
hudmanager - hud resizer and repositioner. pretty useful and included in ctdynamix probably
incoming - send a team message with a direction, bound to numpad
ipc - some sort of player tracker?
jsutffg - looks like a significantly more efficient max grenade throw thing
jsutirc - jsut's T2 IRC client extentions, can't be bothered to read it
jsutmovie - another screenshot movie script
kerbslitepack - autoflare on missile homing, mortar and gl range reticles, joystick and freelook (zzz), deleted throw grenade from public release, deleted 'auto jump on jetpack', shows the bomber reticle for the pilot! (that seems like something that should be a default), deleted deployable indicator stuff, autofire missile upon lock, deleted flare on missile lock, toggle zoom, mousewheel zoom toggle when zooming, default zoom, default fov stuff
killpopup - hud for showing who murdered you (pretty sure i had this)
killshot - take a screenshot when you die lol

pilotmode - // #description = Increase mouse sensitivity whilst pilot, makes it much easier to control the vehicle.
pinghud - this one calls getScores every 4 seconds for ping stats
pizzaclient - pizza's enhanced tournament mode mod, has weird messages like UpdatePizzaHud

playerwaypoint - jsut@kabob.ca right click a cc player to add a waypoint to 'em

spawnweapon - autoswitch to a preferred weapon, also prevent friendly fire

teamassetfinder - automatic waypoints for team assets, neat idea. could probably extend the client list to see them all forever
frostyteamhit - say something upon damaging a teammate
teamsizehud - Small HUD showing team sizes.
teamtv - cute little player cam hud, reuses the AttachCommanderCamera infrastructure though. should probably figure out how to mess with that in demo mode
throwkit - Throws a repair kit with a key-press. (i though this was part of the final bindings already, anyway published 2002)
tink-elf - When you use the elf gun, it will switch to the spinfusor for easy kill =]
tink-freelook - On a held keypress, you will be switched to 3rd person in freelook, depress the binded key, and you will revert to normal.

tr2beacons - beacon inventory status (no idea what that means) and enhanced beacon functionality (continue to not know)
transparent hud mods - a few
tribehighlight - another showgoo user making another highlight script
vecterhud - a vehicle hud mod, one of the few players to make use of the 'compiled script only' distribution method. he also sends himself an email with 'just your resolution, honest'. pretty sus.
      """Notice: For beta testing purposes, when you first install vhud, vhud will automatically send vecter an email stating your name and what resolution you are using.  This is just to see what resolutions are mostly used."""

zalternatemaster - ams script
zsupport-alware, pj, support, voicepack - various libs

## T2TV
t2tv is relatively simple in concept, but has various tweaks to make it more interesting
the general concept is that you record 30 second clips of demos and then viewers are pushed 30 second ogg and rec files
most of the plumbing is around 'fetching and feeding t2 a constant stream of rec files'
i never finished looking into how the playback system worked

(from the readme)
This is done by streaming the demo file from one PC to a high bandwidth server which will then distribute the demo and audio files to all the viewers.

looks like the author used timescaling to slow the game down when the next 30s hasn't finished downloading / the audio stream lags behind, pretty neat
