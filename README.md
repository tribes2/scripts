# recording scripts

Here are some convenient recording scripts written by loop

You can put them in Tribes2/GameData/base/scripts/autoexec/ to enable them

If you have support.vl2, they can go anywhere in the .../scripts/ folder

## client

1. auto-record allows you to automatically capture recordings of every game you play.
2. auto-upload does nothing, but it may automatically upload your recordings to tribesforever.com. Demand for this script will make me write it faster.

## server

1. quiet-observer offers two convenient features: it silences 'DemoBot-Mia is now observing you.' and 'DemoBot-Mia is no longer observing you.' messages. It also prevents the observer timeout kick from kicking the robot every 20 minutes.  (Classic 1.5.2 necessary. quiet-observer is irrelevant if you're already using ChocoTaco's Classic mod).

DemoBot powers a 24/7 Tribes 2 stream @ twitch.tv/t2vault & their demos are automatically added to tribesforever.com
